## Topic Ideas

We're currently prioritising React articles, but we're always open to a wide variety of ideas.

### Browse Our Topic Garden <span>üå±</span>

Take a look at [our list of potential React topics in Notion](https://www.notion.so/egghead/egghead-next-React-Evergreen-Content-Seedlings-8d7f4e234cbc43838c12793382d076bf).  
Each comes with an outline of the key concepts you can structure an article around.

We're also happy to accept articles on any of the following topics:

## Your Audience

Folks who come to egghead are already advanced beginners, intermediate, or expert developers.

They know the basics of web development, and you can safely assume they've been writing JavaScript for at least a few months. Imagine a recent boot camp graduate or someone already working as a junior on a technical team.

They have limited knowledge about the specific thing you're teaching, but infinite intelligence.

## Tone and Voice

You should be friendly, confident, and enthusiastic.

Make your writing clear and free of unnecessary jargon. If jargon is needed, define it and link to helpful resources.

We recommend using [Hemmingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to check the readability level of your writing.

## Mediums and Formats

Because our site is built on Next.js with MDX, you have the ability to add interactive React components into your article (we know, so cool!)

We strongly encourage including visual, code snippets, demos, and interactive elements that [make programming learnable](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/).
Wild, interesting experimentation with the medium of the web is very welcome here.

To cite the marvellous [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/):
