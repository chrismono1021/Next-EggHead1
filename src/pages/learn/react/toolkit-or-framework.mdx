[React](/learn/react) is a toolkit that you can utlize as a framework. The reason React is a toolkit and not a framework is that React has very few opinions about how you should construct applications. Typically you would expect a framework to provide structure and standard practices for building your web applications.

Examples of frameworks that are often compared to React are [Angular](/s/angular) and [Vue](/s/vue). Both of these tools have clear core ideas about **how** you should build a web application and provide opinionated tooling to accomplish that.

With React, the core is a very optimized and low-opinion tool.

This is the reason you see [meta-frameworks](/learn/react/metaframeworks) like Next.js and Gatsby built on top of React that provide more opnionated approaches to developing applications and tooling to support those opinions.

Because of the low-opinion nature of React you are provided with a lot of flexibility and choice when it comes to building your web applications. When you are learning React this extra decision making layer can often feel overwhelming. Unfortunately for many that feeling doesn't go away entirely as you gain experience.
