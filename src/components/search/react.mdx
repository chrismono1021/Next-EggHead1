One of the nice aspects of React is that it is just JavaScript. When you are creating react applications, you are able to use all of your core knowledge avout JavaScript and apply it to the creation of components in React.

Of course, if your JavaScript fundamentals aren't quite there yet, this can be an entirely different challenge!

We highly recommend [Kent C. Dodds's article on JavaScript for React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react) to get an idea of the **essential JavaScript** you'll need to be successful on your React journey.
